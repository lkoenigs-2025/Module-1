Hi, my name is Leah Koenigsberg.
I am from Monsey, NY.

I teach fourth grade girls in the morning, and complete college work in the afternoons.
In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with family and friends.

In highschool, I used my creativity to design school newsletters and to put togeter videos.
Similarly, in the summer as an assistant director of a large daycamp here in Monsey, I created thematic newsletters and flyers.

My sister is a computer programmer who got her degree at Touro Flatbush and it seemed like a field I would also enjoy.
